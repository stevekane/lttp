#Servers are instances of webpages connected to the "hub" at the /server endpoint

When a server connects to the HUB, it becomes an instance of the game running at a
certain URL.  This URL may be passed to other players allowing them to join a match
directly w/ their browser.  Alternatively, they may connect to the /lobby endpoint
and find a server to join from there.

When a server disconnects, the room is destroyed and the url that used to serve it
will now redirect the user to the /lobby route.

A client connects to the websocket HUB onces they are in a specific room.
